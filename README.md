# Training-Center-Project-PHP

PROJECT CONCEPTION
The goal of this project is to discover and learn how to program in PHP using MYSQL. This
project covers good usage of PHP. During the development, new features were learnt and
added features comprising PDO, AJAX, TRIGGERS, and REST. Handling data in databases, and
how to execute and test the application on a XAMP/MAMP server.
The following are some objectives that the application needs to satisfy:
• Creation of multi team project.
• Creation of teams.
• Login Check (Admin/Trainer).
• Project can be edited.
• Teams can be edited.
Development Environment Used

• PLATFORM USED: Windows 10 / MAC OS
• LANGUAGE USED: PHP , JavaScript
• SERVER: XAMPP(Windows) / MAMP ( MAC OS)
• DATABASE: MySql 5.16.17

Major Technologies Used

1. AJAX - AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. In short; AJAX is about loading
data in the background and display it on the webpage, without reloading the
whole page. Examples of applications using AJAX: Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube,
and Face-book tabs.
2. PDO - PDO is a Database Abstraction Layer PDO offers unified interface to
access many different databases. The real PDO benefits are:
Security (prepared statements that are usable)
Usability (many helper functions to automate routine operations)
Reusability (unified API to access multitude of databases, from SQLite to
Oracle)
3. PHP - PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic
and interactive Web pages.PHP is a widely-used, free, and efficient alternative to
competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.
4. MYSQL - MySQL is the most popular Open Source Relational SQL database
management system. MySQL is one of the best RDBMS being used for
developing web-based software applications.
5. XAMPP/MAMP - XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M),
PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it
extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and
deployment purposes. It is a free and open source cross-platform web
server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of
the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written
in the PHP and Perl programming languages.
